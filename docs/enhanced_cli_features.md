python test_enhanced_agent.py
```

## Implementation Details

The enhanced CLI is implemented in:
- `coding_agent/ui/enhanced_cli.py` - Core enhanced CLI module

- `main.py` - Integration points in the main interactive loop

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Visual feedback makes it clear what the agent is doing
2. **Professional Appearance**: Rich formatting gives a polished, modern look
3. **Improved Scannability**: Color coding and icons make output easier to parse
4. **Progress Tracking**: Users can see operations are running, not frozen
5. **Clear Structure**: Phase transitions organize complex multi-step operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
