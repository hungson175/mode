    """Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool. Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

    ## Usage Guidelines

    - **File path must be absolute**, not relative
    - By default, reads up to {Config.DEFAULT_READ_LIMIT} lines starting from the beginning
    - You can optionally specify line_number, limit, and read_mode for better context
    - Lines longer than {Config.DEFAULT_READ_LIMIT} characters will be truncated
    - Results returned using `cat -n` format, with line numbers starting at 1

    ## Read Modes

    - **"top_down"** (default): Read N lines starting from line_number
    - **"middle"**: Read N lines centered around line_number
    - **"bottom_up"**: Read N lines ending at line_number

    ## Supported File Types

    - **Images** (PNG, JPG, etc.) - Contents presented visually as Claude Code is multimodal
    - **PDF files** - Processed page by page, extracting text and visual content
    - **Jupyter notebooks** (.ipynb) - Returns all cells with outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations
    - **Screenshots** - Works with temporary file paths like `/var/folders/123/abc/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_ZfB1tD/Screenshot.png`

    ## Performance Tips

    - You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response
    - It's always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful
    - If you read a file with empty contents, you'll receive a system reminder warning

def write_file(file_path: str, content: str) -> str:
    """Writes a file to the local filesystem.

    ## Usage Guidelines

    - This tool will **overwrite the existing file** if there is one at the provided path
    - If this is an existing file, you **MUST use the Read tool first** to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first
    - **ALWAYS prefer editing existing files** in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required
    - **NEVER proactively create documentation files** (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
    - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked

    ## Best Practices

    - Use absolute file paths (must be absolute, not relative)
    - Read existing files before overwriting them
    - Prefer Edit or MultiEdit tools for modifying existing content
    - Only create new files when specifically required for the task

@tool("Edit")
def edit_file(

) -> str:
    """Performs exact string replacements in files.

    ## Usage Requirements

    - **Must use Read tool first** - This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file
    - When editing text from Read tool output, preserve exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix
    - Line number prefix format: `spaces + line number + tab`. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match
    - **Never include any part of the line number prefix** in the old_string or new_string

    ## Best Practices

    - **ALWAYS prefer editing existing files** in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required
    - Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked
    - The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance
    - Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful for renaming variables
